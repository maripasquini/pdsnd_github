### Project Title
Explore US Bikeshare Data

### Description
In this project, I´ve made use of Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United States: Chicago, New York City, and Washington. I´ve written code to import the data and answer questions about it by computing descriptive statistics.
The data was provided by [Motivate](https://www.motivateco.com/ "Motivate"), a bike share system provider for many major cities in the United States, to uncover bike share usage patterns.

**The Datasets**

Randomly selected data for the first six months of 2017 are provided for all three cities.

**Statistics Computed**

Information provided by the code:

1. Popular times of travel (i.e., occurs most often in the start time)
  * most common month
  * most common day of week
  * most common hour of day


2. Popular stations and trip
  * most common start station
  * most common end station
  * most common trip from start to end (i.e., most frequent combination of start station and end station)


3. Trip duration
  * total travel time
  * average travel time


4. User info
  * counts of each user type
  * counts of each gender (only available for NYC and Chicago)
  * earliest, most recent, most common year of birth (only available for NYC and Chicago)
